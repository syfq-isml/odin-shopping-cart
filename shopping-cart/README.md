6. Users should be able to review their submitted order

The learning outcomes were as follows:

1. Using a routing solution to navigate through pages
2. Design an intuitive and authentic shopping experience
3. Familiarise with state management and use of React hooks
4. Experiment with application testing
5. Implement a CSS methodology

# Reflections
